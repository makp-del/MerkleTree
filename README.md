# MerkleTree
A Java implementation of the Merkle Tree, a cryptographic data structure used to verify data integrity. The project reads a text file, hashes each line using SHA-256, and builds a Merkle Tree to compute the Merkle Root. Useful for understanding blockchain and file verification concepts
